# Trae Trading Bot

A cryptocurrency trading bot with machine learning capabilities and a web-based frontend interface.

## Frontend Interface

The Trae Trading Bot now includes a modern web-based frontend that allows you to:

- Monitor trading statistics and performance
- View open positions and recent trading signals
- Configure bot parameters through a user-friendly interface
- Start and stop the trading bot
- View real-time logs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed:

```
pip install flask flask-cors
```

### Starting the Frontend

To start the web interface, run:

```
python start_frontend.py
```

This will start the API server and automatically open your default web browser to the trading bot interface at http://localhost:5000.

## Using the Frontend

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of your trading activity:

- **Balance**: Shows your current USDT balance
- **Trading Statistics**: Displays total trades, win rate, total PnL, and open positions
- **Performance Chart**: Visualizes your trading performance over time
- **Open Positions**: Lists all currently open trading positions
- **Recent Signals**: Shows recent trading signals generated by the bot

### Configuration

You can configure the trading bot through the sidebar:

1. **Timeframes**: Select between 1 and 3 timeframes (1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
2. **Models**: Choose which prediction models to use (LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
3. **Margin Amount**: Set the USDT margin amount for trades
4. **Leverage**: Configure the leverage multiplier
5. **Trade Cycle Interval**: Set how frequently the bot analyzes the market (in seconds)
6. **Reset DB on Startup**: Toggle whether to reset the database when starting the bot
7. **Train Models if Not Found**: Toggle whether to train models automatically if they're not found

### Starting/Stopping the Bot

Use the "Start Bot" button in the top-right corner to start the trading bot. Once running, the button will change to "Stop Bot" which you can click to stop the bot's operation.

### Logs

The log section in the sidebar displays real-time logs from the trading bot, helping you monitor its activity and troubleshoot any issues.

## Architecture

The frontend consists of:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The user interface
- **Flask API Server**: Connects the frontend to the trading bot
- **Trading Bot Core**: The existing Python-based trading system

## Files

- `static/index.html`: The main frontend HTML file
- `static/css/styles.css`: CSS styles for the frontend
- `static/js/app.js`: JavaScript for frontend functionality
- `api_server.py`: Flask API server that connects the frontend to the trading bot
- `start_frontend.py`: Launcher script to start the web interface

## Note

This frontend is designed to work with the existing Trae trading bot. Make sure all the required dependencies for the trading bot are installed before using the frontend.
